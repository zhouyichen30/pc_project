    This function standardizes and cleans the main cashflow dataset by:

    2. Applying OID and origination fee adjustments to initial outflows
       to reflect day-one yield effects before IRR/MOIC calculation.

    Assumptions
    -----------
    - All 'pik_interest' entries are accrued (capitalized) and therefore removed.
    - OID and origination fees are treated as upfront adjustments to the
      initial investment cashflows.
    - Delayed-draw facilities (e.g., F002) remain unadjusted due to time
      constraints, with interest assumed to accrue on total notional.
